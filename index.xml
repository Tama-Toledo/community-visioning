Two solution options were proposed at this location:
The first option, a Tactical Urbanism &amp;nbsp; approach, calls for an at-grade crossing of US 63 from the NE corner of the intersection to join with the existing sidewalk on the west side of US 63.</description></item><item><title>Tama-Toledo: Broadway at Business 30 (10a)</title><link>/plan/tama-toledo-broadway-at-lincoln-hwy/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Dec 2021 12:33:29 -0600</pubDate><guid>/plan/tama-toledo-broadway-at-lincoln-hwy/</guid><description>This is Tama-Toledo-Broadway-at-Lincoln-Hwy.md, one of two crosswalk projects from the 2021 Community Visioning work that were tagged for combined effort from Tama and Toledo.

The DOT will be presenting their plan for converting HWY 63 through town to a 3 lane hwy this next Tama City Council meeting Monday, June 6. The meeting starts at 5:30pm. I plan on attending. A couple of the Tama group met with council member [obfuscated] last week to talk about our hope to bundle at least part of our project with this plan. [obfuscated] suggests that we discuss this at council meetings as often as possible.</description></item><item><title>A Post from Travis Mullen...</title><link>/2022/06/a-post-from-travis-mullen.../</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jun 2022 18:39:24 -0500</pubDate><guid>/2022/06/a-post-from-travis-mullen.../</guid><description>This shouldn’t have to happen, but in the present there is no other option. This elderly individual is walking in the highway. The highway.
Tama-Toledo Healthy Hometown Committee is working very hard to change this, by making the community more walkable.
Tama and Toledo city leadership: We’ve ignored the need for a continuous sidewalk along highway 63 for decades. Please support the work of the committee to the greatest extent possible and let’s get this done.</description></item><item><title>2022-May-5: Meeting Minutes</title><link>/document/meeting-2022-05-05/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 May 2022 22:23:03 -0500</pubDate><guid>/document/meeting-2022-05-05/</guid><description>This is information from our 5 p.m., May 5, 2022, regular monthly meeting which replaced our walking audit.

Please check out our About &amp;nbsp; page to learn more about the group.
You may also find online resources at the web pages provided by Iowa&amp;rsquo;s Community Visioning organization, specifically the Tama &amp;nbsp; and Toledo &amp;nbsp; pages. However, we found these pages to be difficult to maintain with limited features, so most of what you find there is meant for download only, and eventually we hope to have all of that material here in a more presentable form.</description></item><item><title>STC 'Safe Routes to School' Full Report from 2009</title><link>/document/stc-srts-full-report-2009/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Dec 2021 12:51:39 -0600</pubDate><guid>/document/stc-srts-full-report-2009/</guid><description> Previous Next &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Page: /</description></item><item><title>2021-Dec-8: Meeting Minutes</title><link>/document/meeting-2021-12-08/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Dec 2021 19:13:53 -0600</pubDate><guid>/document/meeting-2021-12-08/</guid><description> Previous Next &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Page: /</description></item><item><title>Contact</title><link>/contact/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Dec 2021 16:01:35 -0600</pubDate><guid>/contact/</guid><description>Use this link to open an email to the committee.</description></item><item><title>About Us</title><link>/about/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Dec 2021 15:44:56 -0600</pubDate><guid>/about/</guid><description>Iowa is perhaps the only state in the U.S. that has a sustained Community Visioning &amp;nbsp; program.
