Two solution options were proposed at this location:
The first option, a Tactical Urbanism &amp;nbsp; approach, calls for an at-grade crossing of US 63 from the NE corner of the intersection to join with the existing sidewalk on the west side of US 63.</description></item><item><title>Tama-Toledo: Broadway at Business 30 (10a)</title><link>/plan/tama-toledo-broadway-at-lincoln-hwy/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Dec 2021 12:33:29 -0600</pubDate><guid>/plan/tama-toledo-broadway-at-lincoln-hwy/</guid><description>This is Tama-Toledo-Broadway-at-Lincoln-Hwy.md, one of two crosswalk projects from the 2021 Community Visioning work that were tagged for combined effort from Tama and Toledo.
