This elderly individual is walking in the highway. The highway.
Tama-Toledo Healthy Hometown Committee is working very hard to change this, by making the community more walkable.
Tama and Toledo city leadership: We’ve ignored the need for a continuous sidewalk along highway 63 for decades. Please support the work of the committee to the greatest extent possible and let’s get this done.</description></item><item><title>Welcome!</title><link>/2021/12/welcome/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Dec 2021 13:05:18 -0600</pubDate><guid>/2021/12/welcome/</guid><description>Welcome to the new internet home of Tama-Toledo Community Visioning! Please check out our About &amp;nbsp; page to learn more about the group.
You may also find online resources at the web pages provided by Iowa&amp;rsquo;s Community Visioning organization, specifically the Tama &amp;nbsp; and Toledo &amp;nbsp; pages. However, we found these pages to be difficult to maintain with limited features, so most of what you find there is meant for download only, and eventually we hope to have all of that material here in a more presentable form.</description></item></channel></rss>
