We are encouraging everyone in Tama County to “Get Their Move on in May” by recording the minutes they moved in a day. Moving can include walking, cycling, playing a sport, or mowing the lawn etc.  You can “Get Your Move On” by yourself, or with another person or even a group or family.

To make it interesting, we’re going to see how far we can make it around the globe during the month. To make the math easy, we are going to assume that we are moving at one mile a minute. So if you walk for 60 minutes, you have moved us 60 miles on our journey. Check out the chart and the miles totaled below to see how we are doing!

If you choose to enter your minutes as a group, multiply your minutes “moved” by the number in your group. If your group “moved” more than 120 minutes, please enter that information by logging in a couple of times. For example, 5 people walked for 60 minutes totaling 300 minutes. (5 X 60 = 300). Log in and enter 120 minutes. Log in again and enter 120 minutes. Log in again and enter 60 minutes. (120 + 120 + 60 = 300). Of course, each group member can log their own. NO PERSONAL DATA WILL BE KEPT. NO EMAIL ADDRESSES ETC. ARE RECORDED.
