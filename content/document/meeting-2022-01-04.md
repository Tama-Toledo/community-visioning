Subject: Healthy Hometown information 

Denise, 

Thank you for hosting today's call, I enjoyed learning more about Toledo and Tama and the work you are doing. Attached, for your review is...... 

Sustainability flyer-this will give you metrics and information why Healthy Hometown is important and why Wellmark is involved. 

Community Guide-this details the 4 step process, most importantly forming a comprehensive committee (and suggestions for who to include). 

I look forward to hearing from you following your Thursday meeting, if there is any additional information you need, please let me know, thanks.
