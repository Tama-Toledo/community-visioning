This shouldn’t have to happen, but in the present there is no other option.  This elderly individual is walking in the highway. The highway.  

Tama-Toledo Healthy Hometown Committee is working very hard to change this, by making the community more walkable.  
 
Tama and Toledo city leadership: We’ve ignored the need for a continuous sidewalk along highway 63 for decades.  Please support the work of the committee to the greatest extent possible and let’s get this done.  

PLEASE SHARE.  
PLEASE ASK OUR LOCAL LEADERSHIP TO ACT NOW- NOT LATER.
