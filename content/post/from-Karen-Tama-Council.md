Hello Tama/Toledo Visioning Team,

The DOT will be presenting their plan for converting HWY 63 through town to a 3 lane hwy this next Tama City Council meeting Monday, June 6. The meeting starts at 5:30pm. I plan on attending. A couple of the Tama group met with council member [obfuscated] last week to talk about our hope to bundle at least part of our project with this plan.  [obfuscated] suggests that we discuss this at council meetings as often as possible.  Therefore, I also have the Tama/Toledo Visioning Team on the agenda.

I hope some of you can attend to learn about how the conversion plans affect Tama and in support of the crosswalk/sidewalk plan in Tama. The [obfuscated] may still be out of town and they usually attend with me. 

Thanks and let me know if you have any questions.

Karen M
