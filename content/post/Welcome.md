Welcome to the new internet home of _Tama-Toledo Community Visioning!_  Please check out our [About](https://cv.tamatoledo.org/about/) page to learn more about the group.  

You may also find online resources at the web pages provided by Iowa's Community Visioning organization, specifically the [Tama](https://communityvisioning.org/tama) and [Toledo](https://communityvisioning.org/toledo) pages.  However, we found these pages to be difficult to maintain with limited features, so most of what you find there is meant for download only, and eventually we hope to have all of that material here in a more presentable form.

Also be sure to check out our [Documents](https://cv.tamatoledo.org/documents) and [Events](https://cv.tamatoledo.org/events) pages.  Just today, 21-December-2021, we added a 44-page `Safe Routes to School` report from 2009.  There's lots of valuable information in that document so be sure to check it out along with other [Plans](https://cv.tamatoledo.org/plans) that we are sharing.

One other resource I encourage you to visit is [@Summitt Dweller Â· I Like to Hike](https://hikes.summittdweller.com) and some of the CV-related hikes in the "Featured" section there, like https://hikes.summittdweller.com/hikes/highlighted/2021-11-22_4.48pm/ and https://hikes.summittdweller.com/hikes/highlighted/2021-03-13_9.45am/.

We also welcome your feedback and participation! There's a `Contact Us` link (the envelope icon) at the bottom of every page.  Just click that link to open an email addressed to this group.  Also, as mentioned above, check out our [Events](https://cv.tamatoledo.org/events) page to keep tabs on upcoming opportunities to get involved.  We would love to hear from you and see you at our next meeting!

Take care.
