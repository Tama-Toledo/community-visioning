The Tama side of the Visioning Team will be presenting at the Tama City Council meeting on Monday, June 20 at 5:30pm. This time we will be included as a discussion/action item. This allows the Council to make some decisions.  Karen and Shelly have worked on a more formal presentation. We would appreciate it if some of you could attend to lend support. You will not have to talk unless you want to comment on something.
