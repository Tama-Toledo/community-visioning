The original committees from Tama and Toledo, and others who wish to join the effort, are invited to meet and discuss organization, priorities, and next steps.

This meeting will be held in the **large meeting room near the back** of the Tama Civic Center to avoid potential conflicts at the Wieting Theatre with the summer play, "Rehearsal for Murder".

The agenda for this meeting was never received.
