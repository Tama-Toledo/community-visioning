Earlier in the year we had a very successful "Walking Audit" in Toledo.  Now it's Tama's turn.  On September 15 we have planned a [Walking Audit](https://www.aarp.org/livable-communities/getting-around/aarp-walk-audit-tool-kit/) around downtown Tama conducted by an experienced representative from Wellmark's [Healthy Hometown](https://www.wellmark.com/about/community/community-health-improvement/iowa) initiative.

The AARP (American Association of Retired Persons) describes a walking audit as:

...a simple activity in which an individual or a team observes and evaluates the walkability of a location to document how and if pedestrians can safely travel along a street, navigate an intersection and get from point A to B, C and so on.
