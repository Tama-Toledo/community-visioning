I forwarded to you an invitation from Jon Werger with the Wellmark Foundation. Jared Morford from Iowa Kids on the Move recommended them as a great partner with resources to share. Application must be submitted by February 16th. We have set up a call on Tuesday, January 4th at 1 p.m. to explain the process and answer our questions. He thought it would take 30 minutes. I would appreciate another set of ears and ask that anyone available please sit in on this call. They will fund up to $100,000 with a Dollar-for-Dollar match with at least 1/2 of that in cash. 

I also have some books and information from the AARP Community Challenge Grant. 38% of their funding goes to rural communities. Their application process opens in February with an April deadline. 

Please let me know before or at the meeting on the 6th some funding sources that you may have found.
