**There will be NO regular meeting in September.**  

The original committees from Tama and Toledo, and others who wish to join the effort, are invited to meet and discuss organization, priorities, and next steps.

This meeting will be held in the **large meeting room near the back** of the Tama Civic Center to avoid potential conflicts with events at the Wieting Theatre.

Agenda specifics:  To be announced at a later date.
