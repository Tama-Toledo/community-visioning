Minutes from our last meeting on March 3, 2022, are now available at [this link](./document/meeting-2022-03-03/).

Our April "meeting" will actually be a [Walking Audit](https://www.aarp.org/livable-communities/getting-around/aarp-walk-audit-tool-kit/) conducted by an experienced representative from Wellmark's [Healthy Hometown](https://www.wellmark.com/about/community/community-health-improvement/iowa) initiative.  **Everyone is invited to attend and walk together!**  

The AARP (American Association of Retired Persons) describes a walking audit as:

...a simple activity in which an individual or a team observes and evaluates the walkability of a location to document how and if pedestrians can safely travel along a street, navigate an intersection and get from point A to B, C and so on.
{{% /box %}}

_Specifics_: We will meet outside the Wieting Theatre at 5 PM and walk through Downtown Toledo, then we will walk to the former Iowa Juvenile Home site, and continue on to the intersection of Business 30 and Broadway. **Wear comfortable walking shoes and dress for the weather!**

Additional details will be posted here as they become available.  

Agenda specifics:

  - Walking Audit as described above.
