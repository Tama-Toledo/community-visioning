This is the overall concept plan for Tama-Toledo split into eight pages.  The first page includes some comments about the overall plan along with a legend of specific project highlights.  Those highlights appear on maps of Toledo (page 2) and Tama (page 3).  A small overlap of Toledo into Tama, and vis-versa is provided for reference and alignment.

The remaining pages include:

  - Page 4: A summary of trail/sidewalk segments *A* through *N* with total estimated costs.
  - Page 5: Estimated cost details for segments *B*, *C*, *E*, and *F*.
  - Page 6: Estimated cost details for segments *F* (repeated), *G*, *H*, and *I*.
  - Page 7: Estimated cost details for segments *J*, *K*, *L*, and *M*.
