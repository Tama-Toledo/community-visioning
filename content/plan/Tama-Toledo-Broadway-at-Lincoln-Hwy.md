This is PLAN _Tama-Toledo-Broadway-at-Lincoln-Hwy.md_ with a pair of initial cost estimates included.  This is one of two intersection-specific projects from the 2021 Community Visioning work that were tagged for combined effort from Tama and Toledo.  

Note that the estimate for 2300 square feet of concrete trail, 8 feet in width, as part of the intersection project is equivalent to `2300 sf / 8 ft = 287.5 linear feet` of trail or sidewalk.  Reducing the width from 8 feet to 6 feet would save an estimated $4,500.  Also, **pages 2 and 3 in the PDF have been modified** to correct typographic errors and to suggest a slightly modified path for the southeast corner of the _S. Broadway_/_Business 30_ intersection.

The last page of the PLAN lists the estimated costs for a 6-foot-wide sidewalk, roughly 780 feet connecting the _S. Broadway_/_Business 30_ intersection to Toledo's existing sidewalk network at the northeast corner of _Mill Street_ and _S. Broadway_.
