This is PLAN _Tama-Toledo-Broadway-at-Lincoln-Hwy.md_ with a pair of initial cost estimates included.  This is one of two intersection-specific projects from the 2021 Community Visioning work that were tagged for combined effort from Tama and Toledo.  

Note that the estimate for 2300 square feet of concrete trail, 8 feet in width, as part of the intersection project is equivalent to `2300 sf / 8 ft = 287.5 linear feet` of trail or sidewalk, and that amount covers just the area immediately around two intersections on _S. Broadway_, one at _Business 30_ and the other at _2nd Street_.  Reducing the width from 8 feet to 6 feet would save an estimated $4,500.  Also, **pages 2 and 3 in the PDF have been modified** to correct typographic errors and to suggest a slightly modified path for the southeast corner of the _S. Broadway_/_Business 30_ intersection.

The last page of the PLAN lists the estimated costs for a 6-foot-wide sidewalk, roughly 780 feet connecting the _S. Broadway_/_Business 30_ intersection to Toledo's existing sidewalk network at the northeast corner of _Mill Street_ and _S. Broadway_.  That original estimate did NOT include a necessary retaining wall on the east side of _S. Broadway_ at the southeast corner of the _Mill Street_ intersection.  

On March 1, 2022, citizens in the South Tama County Community School District passed a $25,000,000 (plus) bond issue to build a new STC Middle School on the grounds of the former Iowa Juvenile Home (IJH).  That development will almost certainly make a safer US 30/Broadway crossing, and connecting pedestrian routes, more important than ever.  Shortly after the vote members of this committee reached out to the design firm that helped with our planning in 2021 and returned with these adjusted and additional estimated cost figures:

  | Scope | Estimated Cost | Note |
  | ---   | --- | --- |
  | Two intersection improvements on S. Broadway at Business 30 and 2nd Street | $42,775 | As originally estimated* |
  | Segment E - Broadway from Mill St. to 2nd St., just south of the aforementioned intersection | $139,035 | As originally estimated* |
  | Retaining Wall as mentioned above. 120 lineal ft. x $75/ft. | $9,000 | Not in original estimate |
  | Sidewalk from Mill Street/Broadway east to Church St. and future STC Middle School grounds | $19,800 | Not in original estimate | 
  | **Total** | **$210,610** | |  
  <p/>

*Note that the designer acknowledges the original estimates are conservative, and assuming relatively strict DOT funding sources.  Actual costs/bids are not expected to come in this high and are unlikely to be exceeded in the near future.
