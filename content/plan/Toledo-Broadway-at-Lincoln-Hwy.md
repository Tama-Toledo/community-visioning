This is PLAN _Toledo-Broadway-at-Lincoln-Hwy.md_ with a pair of initial cost estimates included.  

Note that the estimate for 2300 square feet of concrete trail, 8 feet in width, as part of the intersection project is equivalent to `2300 sf / 8 ft = 287.5 linear feet` of trail or sidewalk.  Reducing the width from 8 feet to 6 feet would save an estimated $4,500.

The last page of the PLAN lists the estimated costs for a 6-foot-wide sidewalk, roughly 780 feet connecting the _S. Broadway_/_Business 30_ intersection to Toledo's existing sidewalk network at the northeast corner of _Mill Street_ and _S. Broadway_.
