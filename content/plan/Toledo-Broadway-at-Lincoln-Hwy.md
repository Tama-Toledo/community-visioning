This is PLAN _Toledo-Broadway-at-Lincoln-Hwy.md_ with an initial cost estimate included.  

Note that the estimate for 2300 square feet of concrete trail, 8 feet in width, is equivalent to `2300 sf / 8 ft = 287.5 lineal feet of trail`.  The last page of the PLAN is estimated cost for a 6-foot-wide sidewalk connecting the _S. Broadway_/_Lincoln Highway_ intersection to Toledo's existing sidewalk network at the northeast corner of _Mill Street_ and _S. Broadway_.
