Please check out our About &amp;nbsp; page to learn more about the group.
You may also find online resources at the web pages provided by Iowa&amp;rsquo;s Community Visioning organization, specifically the Tama &amp;nbsp; and Toledo &amp;nbsp; pages. However, we found these pages to be difficult to maintain with limited features, so most of what you find there is meant for download only, and eventually we hope to have all of that material here in a more presentable form.</description></item></channel></rss>
