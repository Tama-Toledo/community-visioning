The original committees from Tama and Toledo, and others who wish to join the effort, are invited to meet and discuss organization, priorities, and next steps.
This meeting will be held in the large meeting room near the back of the Tama Civic Center to avoid potential conflicts with events at the Wieting Theatre.
Agenda specifics: To be announced at a later date.</description></item><item><title>Healthiest State Annual Walk - Tama County</title><link>/event/2022-10-05-healthiest-state-walk/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/event/2022-10-05-healthiest-state-walk/</guid><description>Letâ€™s get walking Tama County!
