Due to weather concerns this event has been POSTPONED to Thursday, May 5 at 5 PM. Everyone is invited to attend and walk together!
We will have a regular meeting at the Wieting, 5 PM, April 7, instead of the Walking Audit and that meeting agenda is available here .</description></item></channel></rss>
