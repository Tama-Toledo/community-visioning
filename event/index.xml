For our April &amp;ldquo;meeting&amp;rdquo; we had planned a Walking Audit &amp;nbsp; conducted by an experienced representative from Wellmark&amp;rsquo;s Healthy Hometown &amp;nbsp; initiative. Due to weather concerns this event has been POSTPONED to May 4 at 5 PM. Everyone is invited to attend and walk together!
We will have a regular meeting at the Wieting, 5 PM, April 7, instead of the Walking Audit.</description></item></channel></rss>
