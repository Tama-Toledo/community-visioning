We have reflector vests to give out to participants who need one as well as bottled water. The program shouldn&amp;rsquo;t take more than 10 minutes. Our hope is that this gives walkers and bikers a sense of safety and residents become more active. Please plan to attend this short but important program.</description></item></channel></rss>
