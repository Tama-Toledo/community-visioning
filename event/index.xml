Our April &amp;ldquo;meeting&amp;rdquo; will actually be a Walking Audit &amp;nbsp; conducted by an experienced representative from Wellmark&amp;rsquo;s Healthy Hometown &amp;nbsp; initiative. Everyone is invited to attend and walk together!
The AARP (American Association of Retired Persons) describes a walking audit as:
&amp;hellip;a simple activity in which an individual or a team observes and evaluates the walkability of a location to document how and if pedestrians can safely travel along a street, navigate an intersection and get from point A to B, C and so on.</description></item></channel></rss>
